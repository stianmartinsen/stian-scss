StianSCSS
=============
This plugin for Sublime Text 3 will clean up ugly SCSS code. I find myself doing the same search/replace over and over again, and as the lazy programmer I am, I decided to write a plugin for this.

This plugin will make my life easier by:

* Removing trailing whitespace
* Forcing space before opening curly bracket
* Forcing newline before new selector
